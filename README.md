# Race Card Viewer

This project will display basic thoroughbred horse race race information using data pulled from datafiles provided.

First run of the application creates a 'Race Card Viewer' in the user's Documents directory along with data file and log directories under this main directory. The data file directory will be populated with sample files for viewing.

The user will be prompted with a list of datafiles to choose from for a given date and race track (the Race Day list). It will subsequently display the list of races. A race may then be selected to view the list of horses entered in the race along with basic information about the horse.

## Technologies Used

## Minimum Feature List Requirements To Be Implemented

 - Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.
 - Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in the program.
 - Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file.
 - Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in the application.
 - Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file.
